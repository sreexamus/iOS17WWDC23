WWWWDC23 iOS17 Updates:-

SwiftUI Updates:-

1. SwiftData Framework introduced to replace CoreData. No need of creating Model file and define the properties in it. we just need to use Model Macro.
   @Model
   Class Student {
      var name: String
      var age: Int
   }
2. KeyFrames introduced for smooth animation letting us to define multiple values of properties with timing, motiton for each property , pitch, heading etc.
3. ObservableObject is no longer needed in iOS17. we just need to use Observable macro for the class. All public varaibles will be published.
    @Observable
    class GoodsFarmViewModel {
       var name: String
       var details: String
    }

   struct GoodView: View {
      var viewModel: GoodsFarm
   }
